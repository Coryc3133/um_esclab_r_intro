There are two datasets stored here that we use in the tutorial:

## `pragmatic_scales_data.csv` 

These are data from [Stiller, Goodman, & Frank (2015), LLD](http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/stiller-2015-lld.pdf), a study of preschooler's pragmatic inferencing abilities. The primary question here was whether children were able to make correct pragmatic inferences A) above chance and B) above control condition performance. A secondary question was about developmental change in this ability.

Variables:
* `subid` - subject identifier
* `item` - base object for the inference, e.g. "my HOUSE has flowers"
* `correct` - whether the pragmatic inference was made correctly 
* `age` - age in years
* `condition` - experimental Label (pragmatic inference) or No Label control (puppet has peanut butter in mouth)

## `another_data_set.csv`

This is a fake dataset that was created for the tutorial (simply for learning to import & export data).
